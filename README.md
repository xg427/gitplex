last open source copy of GitPlex for now, licensed with MIT

GitPlex decided they didn't want to be open source, at least for now.
However, they said they are fine with my fork and public repo,
this is the last version of GitPlex to date which is fully open source, if you want to improve it, 
please do it publicly with PR's, or a fork.
